# My-DSA-Journey
This repository will be containing my entire DSA journey right from scratch.

I will be uploading my entire learning from Day 1, i.e. tomorrow March 18, 2023 along with code files. I am open to suggestions if somebody have for me. Also, if I don't upload my work some day then I want you guys to critique me so that I stay on track and don't lose my focus. I will be really grateful if you guys support me through this journey. The resources I will be using are as follows -

1. Code with Harry - C++ Tutorials (YouTube)
2. Geeks for Geeks DSA Self Paced Course
3. CodeHelp - DSA with C++ Plalist (YouTube)

The programming language used will be C++.

1. Pointers & Pointer Arithmetic (2 days)
2. Structures, Unions & Enums (1 days)
3. Object Oriented Programming (7 days)
4. Bit Manipulation (3 days)
5. Recursion (3 days)
